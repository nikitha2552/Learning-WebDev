        <h1><u>HTML</u></h1>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating and
            structuring the
            content of websites and web pages. HTML uses a system of tags to define the structure and layout of a
            webpage's
            elements, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1><u>CSS</u></h1>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and
            visual
            appearance of HTML (and XML) documents. CSS allows web developers to control the layout, formatting, and
            design of web
            pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing look across different devices and browsers.

            Instead of defining the appearance of each individual HTML element within the HTML code itself, CSS
            separates the
            presentation from the content. This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and update the styles
            across an
            entire website.

            CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements using selectors. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a set
            of
            declarations enclosed in curly braces. Each declaration consists of a property and its corresponding value
